## Code IN "Programming Collective Intelligence
### Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications"

This is a website for a Git repo with all coding examples and exercices from the book [_Programming Collective Intelligence Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications_](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do), written by Toby Segaran and published by O'Reilly Media 2008. 

The code was updated and is written in this version in Python 3.6.

The code has been commented and explained. The theory behind the algorithms used is explained and its implementation briefly summarized.

Here there is a brief summary of every chapter:


**2. Making recommendations.** Collaborative filtering techniques that enable online retailers to recommend products or media.
**3. Discovering groups.** Methods of clustering to detect groups of similar items in a large dataset.
**4. Searchin and ranking.** Crawlers, indexers, query engines, and the PageRank algorithm.
**5. Optimization.** Optimization algorithms that search millions of possible solutions to a problem and choose the best one.
**6. Document filtering.** Bayesian filtering, used in spam filters for classifying documents based on word types and other features.
**7. Modeling with decision trees.** Using decision trees not only to make predictions, but to model the way decisions are made.
**8. Building price models.** Predicting numerical values rather than classifications to build price models.
**9. Advanced classification: Kernel methors and SVMs.** Support vector machines to match people in online dating sites.
**10. Finding independent features.** Non-negative matrix factorization to find the independent features in a dataset.
**11. Evolving intelligence.** For problem solving -- how a computer develops its skill by improving its own code the more it plays a game.
